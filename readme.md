## About This sample project

This was my last project for a client ([Rádio Estúdio Brasil](http://www.radiostudiobrasil.com.br)).
Developed with:
- VueJS
- Laravel 5.6 / PHP 7.1 / MySQL 5.7
- Docker

I was responsible for the production server setup.

It's using a [TUS server](https://packagist.org/packages/oneofftech/laravel-tus-upload) to enable big file (GB) resumable uploads through HTTP.
