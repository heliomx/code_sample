## About This sample project

This is my last project for a client ([Rádio Estúdio Brasil](http://www.radiostudiobrasil.com.br)).
Developed with:
- VueJS
- Laravel 5.6 / PHP 7.1 / MySQL 5.7
- Docker

It's using a [TUS server](https://packagist.org/packages/oneofftech/laravel-tus-upload) to enable big file (GB) resumable uploads through HTTP. 

I was responsible for the production server setup and configuration (Ubuntu 16 LTS)
